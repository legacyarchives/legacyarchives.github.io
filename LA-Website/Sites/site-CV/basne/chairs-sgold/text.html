				<h2>CHAIRS</h2>
				<h3>Samuel Gold | Báseň</h3>
				<hr>

<p>The chairs running through the street
			<br/>
Through the drains of what we called humanity
			<br/>
To the grasps of wailing men
			<br/>
Waiting for pleasure yet so blind
			<br/>
			<br/>
A crowd gathers around dusk
			<br/>
Watching a man in the middle fail
			<br/>
Crying and weeping everyone laughing
			<br/>
Dropping down his books one by one
			<br/>
Considering his idol's luxury
			<br/>
Thinking a replica for himself
			<br/>
			<br/>
A man lost in the winds of society
			<br/>
Blaming his reckless drinking and smoking on them
			<br/>
To the blistering reality of rejection
			<br/>
Rejection which occurs unconditionally
			<br/>
His only loyal bystander
			<br/>
Disappointment becomes a norm
			<br/>
			<br/>
And yet he strides forward
			<br/>
Strides for failure and disappointment
			<br/>
Studying endlessly in a cycle
			<br/>
Expected for medicine or law
			<br/>
Free yet blinded by beliefs and morals
			<br/>
Suggesting his opinions to be clichÃ©
			<br/>
			<br/>
Dreaming to become a chair
			<br/>
The chair that sits on people
			<br/>
Running and killing yet fulfilling
			<br/>
From the castle to a random house
			<br/>
From culture and history 
			<br/>
A peak to a life of mystery
			<br/>
Full of genius minds intoxicated by joy
			<br/>
Seizing the day and becoming superman
			<br/>
			<br/>
Contemplating rap and drums
			<br/>
Forgetting the uninvited
			<br/>
The chair moves on slowly yet steadily
			<br/>
Running to the deepest corners of love
			<br/>
Seeing failure as a success
			<br/>
A wooden heart nevertheless
			<br/>
			<br/>
Lying to his closest justified by career
			<br/>
Imagine a world dominated by fear
			<br/>
Fear of the unknown and strange
			<br/>
Brings one's mind into rage
			<br/>
God created man and man created chair
			<br/>
Hidden in it eternal lair
			<br/>
			<br/>
Forgotten and found in times of trust
			<br/>
Betrayed by its own lust
			<br/>
The chair saw mountains and talent
			<br/>
Dark snow with frozen white rain
			<br/>
The white beaches of plastic
			<br/>
The sand of doom
			<br/>
			<br/>
Yet the young remain stupid and blind
			<br/>
A lie repeated constantly becomes reality
			<br/>
Young waging war with likes
			<br/>
Ignoring there won't be one to wage
			<br/>
Blind and naive as chairs
			<br/>
Falling down without a backbone
			<br/>
Manipulated and excluded
			<br/>
Problematic yet never recruited 
			<br/>
			<br/>
Lost potential and ruin
			<br/>
Awaits the chairs soon
			<br/>
Useless as no Wi-Fi and a talking baboon
			<br/>
Yet hope is the equivalent to fair
			<br/>
Sunk in our morals like a chair

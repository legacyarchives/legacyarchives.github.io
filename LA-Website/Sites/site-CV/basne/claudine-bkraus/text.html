				<h2>CLAUDINE</h2>
				<h3>B. Kraus | Báseň</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>I was just sitting 
			<br/>
Drinking some gin and lime 
			<br/>
When she walked up to me 
			<br/>
Asked me if I was fine 
			<br/>
			<br/>
I looked up 
			<br/>
Right into her eyes 
			<br/>
At that time I couldn't see 
			<br/>
They were full of lies 
			<br/>
			<br/>
At that night 
			<br/>
With a hardened voice 
			<br/>
She asked me to dance 
			<br/>
I had to make my choice 
			<br/>
			<br/>
But there was one thing 
			<br/>
I couldn't understand 
			<br/>
Why she looked like a woman 
			<br/>
But talked like a man? 
			<br/>
She took me to dance 
			<br/>
And took the lead
			<br/>
 I was surprised 
			<br/>
It was a daring deed 
			<br/>
			<br/>
Now there is one thing 
			<br/>
I really couldn't understand 
			<br/>
She looked like a doll 
			<br/>
Made up in my head 
			<br/>
She took my hand 
			<br/>
And we kissed for a while 
			<br/>
"Won't you come home with me?" 
			<br/>
She said with a smile 
			<br/>
			<br/>
We walked home 
			<br/>
In the deep dark night 
			<br/>
There was this feeling 
			<br/>
I had to fight 
			<br/>
			<br/>
We went for the bedroom 
			<br/>
And she locked the door 
			<br/>
But as she got undressed 
			<br/>
I fell to the floor 
			<br/>
			<br/>
She looked at me 
			<br/>
"Never seen a woman before?"
			<br/>
I had to explain
			<br/>
 I can't handle her no more
			<br/>
But there is one thing 
			<br/>
I can't understand 
			<br/>
How easily I could be fooled 
			<br/>
With gin and a rock n roll band 
			<br/>
It's a confusing little world 
			<br/>
Say that I can 
			<br/>
Where men dress up as women 
			<br/>
But talk like a man 
			<br/>
			<br/>
But there is one thing 
			<br/>
I can't understand 
			<br/>
How I didn't feel the grip 
			<br/>
When she took my hand 
			<br/>
I am not the world's 
			<br/>
Most observant guy 
			<br/>
But it's a mystery 
			<br/>
How I fell for such a lie 
			<br/>
			<br/>
But there is one thing 
			<br/>
I can't understand 
			<br/>
How I went with her 
			<br/>
Charmed by her command 
			<br/>
Boys want to be girls 
			<br/>
And girls want to boys 
			<br/>
Some want a gender change 
			<br/>
Others a new Rolls Royce 
			<br/>
			<br/>
She was so sweet 
			<br/>
I almost believed 
			<br/>
But I'm glad I'm a man 
			<br/>
And that she let me leave 
			<br/>
			<br/>
It's a confusing world 
			<br/>
Living here 
			<br/>
You never know whom you're inviting 
			<br/>
For a dance or a glass of beer 
			<br/>
And I might miss her 
			<br/>
Or her moves so dear 
			<br/>
But at least I know the truth 
			<br/>
At least it's all clear

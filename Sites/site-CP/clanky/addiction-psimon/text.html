				<h2>ADDICTION</h2>
				<h3>Peter Simon | Článok</h3>
				<hr>
			<p>In this article I will try to describe my own perspective on addiction. I will give some insight on how I classify addiction, and compare to other people examples of addiction or definitions.</p>

<p>Addiction in literary terms described by healthline is:</p>

<p>&ldquo;An addiction is a chronic dysfunction of the brain system that involves reward, motivation, and memory. It&rsquo;s about the way your body craves a substance or behavior, especially if it causes a compulsive or obsessive pursuit of &ldquo;reward&rdquo; and lack of concern over consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anything concerned with rewarding the brain, dopamine, is an addiction. Even eating can be addiction, if the reward rewards something unhealthy - like unhealthy snacking. If dopamine isn&rsquo;t released for the right occasion it becomes an addiction. I think our bodies can&rsquo;t determine what the right decision could be for the future. We have to be able to judge ourselves when an addiction becomes real, and when we are doing good.</p>

<p>There are certain addictions that can be considered good - for example wanting more. It helps people to work harder, but it might be unhealthy in other scenarios - stress, not being able to rest. In this blog, I will focus more on unnecessary addictions. Those that provide short term happiness - dopamine release - but in the long run cause you to want more and become depressed without it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of addictions in this new generation. With the internet available to almost anyone with a phone, a lot of stuff becomes reachable and it is harder to control people&rsquo;s desires. This can be looked on as chance to get addicted - or more freedom - with consequences. Similarly to how drugs - when banned - can prevent addictions from happening, the internet is also a drug which can create addictions. Blocking certain connections will help avoid some addictions - but it can also drive them crazy - to somehow find a way to fulfill their addiction. In my opinion - the alternative (freedom of choice) is better with both choices.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most prevalent addictions each of us encountered during quarantine are social media and self-pleasure. Although it may sound cringey, we encounter it every day, and go through waves of addiction &ldquo;triggers&rdquo;. Those moments where we just automatically turn into doing what our unconscious says, engaging in either activity. There isn&rsquo;t a lot people can do in quarantine, as social distancing doesn&rsquo;t allow contact between other people, and we miss each interactions lost due to this situation. Would banning these addictions help - definitely not. We would just crave them more, to somehow get to them.</p>

<p>I feel to truly get through addiction, any kind of &ldquo;drug&rdquo;, a person has to go through rehabilitation and change their perspective on taking drugs. For example, if someone bans the use of alcohol, it doesn&rsquo;t help the person&rsquo;s addiction. In my opinion, not being able to drink alcohol is different from not wanting to drink. I think most governments fail to recognize this perspective, and look to deal with addiction problems with short-term solutions - banning the specific addiction. However, to get through to people, I think it comes from only education and changing perspective.</p>

<p>In conclusion, addictions that provide short-term happiness and nothing in the long-run, are best to prevent. For people to avoid addiction, in my opinion, changing the perspective is the only way to stop addiction. If we as people can be smarter and outweigh the pros and cons, of doing a drug (without the created pressure of the government - but consuming the addiction), we can eliminate most of addiction-related problems.</p>

<p>In the next blog I will be taking a further look into how to prevent yourself from taking short-term happiness, and my coping mechanism to do this.</p>
